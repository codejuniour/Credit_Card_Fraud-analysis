# Credit_Card_Fraud-analysis

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset

dataset link:-https\://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIvIdqdHDFEGnfzIgEh4L6GFirzsE3US/view

The dataset contains real-world transactions with features such as:

- Transaction amount
- Timestamp
- Various anonymized numerical features
- Class label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

```

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Importing Libraries** â€“ Load required Python libraries.
2. **Loading Data** â€“ Read and explore the dataset.
3. **Understanding Data** â€“ Check for missing values and feature distributions.
4. **Handling Imbalance** â€“ Use techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
5. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Scale and transform data as needed.
6. **Model Training** â€“ Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
7. **Evaluation** â€“ Measure performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Installation & Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ML___Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with deep learning models.
- Implement real-time fraud detection.
- Improve feature selection and engineering.
